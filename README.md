<h3> Description </h3>
<hr>
<b>The project is named Vyakula</b> - Vyakula is a Swahili word that can be translated to English as Cuisine. The idea was inspired from a customer centric approach to create an experience centered around their preferences. To provide rich tapestry of local cuisines, we aimed to celebrate diversity through our menu. <br>We understand the joy of savoring exquisite dishes without leaving the comfort of your home. Our platform is a haven for food enthusiasts, offering a seamless and delightful food delivery experience. We noticed a lack of online platforms specifically dedicated to African cuisine, this have since been a driving force to create something unique and valuable to cater for our peoples' needs.<br>
